Title of the System: Attendance System for Students and Lecturer

Problem Domain:
Keeping track of attendance is a fundamental requirement in educational institutions. The system should allow a lecturer to take attendance for students in a class and also log their own attendance for the class session. It ensures accurate records of who attended and when.

What the System Does:
This system is designed to manage attendance records for students and lecturers. It tracks the presence of students during a class session and logs the lecturerâ€™s attendance as well. This helps maintain accountability and provides a clear record for institutional use.
